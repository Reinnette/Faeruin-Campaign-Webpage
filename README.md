This is a work in progress website I started rather than making a traditional pdf for table top roleplay that I am leading. 

All items in hear are in a rough draft state so that the heart of the needed features can be implemented. 

<h1>Planned Features</h1>

<h2>Character Creation</h2>
This is a planned seperate page that will be created for the sole purpose as being the location for each player to make their own characters.
  It will be a fully self contained document that will require a single file to be passed around untill I can get to setting up proper domain hosting on my local server.

<h2>Encounter Builder</h2>
One of the hardest parts of each session is gathering and planning the encounters that can be had per session.
Expanding apon the Creatures/Monsters page it will adapt to have the following
<ul>
  <li>- An option to see a summary of each monster that can expand into the current full view.</li>
  <li>- An option to seach/filter monsters</li>
  <li>
    <div><p>- An option to generate an encounter based on party AVG Damage, AVG Health, Number of Players, Filter Data, and Difficulty</p>
        <p>Each of these items will be ran through the database of monsters to then give a list of suggestions based on the criteria.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
