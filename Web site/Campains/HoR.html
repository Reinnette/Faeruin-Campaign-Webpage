        <div>
            <h3>	Base Story</h3>
            <p>	The story will take the players throughout the kingdom and surrounding forests. </p>
            <p>	Along the way the players will learn the lore to the kingdom and who the Spirit of the Forest is as well as the state she’s in</p>

            <h4><b>ARC 0(Lvl-3) - Introduction</b></h4>
            <br />
            <h4>Arc Purpose</h4>
            <p>	In this arc players will learn more about the town and using their partner spirits</p>

            <br />

            <h4>Arc Hook</h4>
            <p>
                The players are introduced as the town is being attacked, each player in a different area depending on their origin. The players then hear several loud bells ringing in the distance.
                Several towns folk can be heard exclaiming this is the worst one yet.
                A guard will can be hear screaming that there's a stampede and everyone needs to get out and things are going to get ugly real fast.
                As the players get outside they see medium, large, and a few huge spirits like woodland creatures. They are currently at the East gate and have [color] color to them.
                Those that are native to this area and or to the colors region would know that these beasts should not appear there.
                Upon trying to flee the city the party will group up and guards will be directing people to enter an underground tunnel system that will lead out of the city but escape the hoard above.
                As the players come along a near by building will start to collapse with them and some npc's in toe. Leaving barley enough time for only the party to make it unless they do somthing.
                Once inside the tunnle system the building will fully collapse closing off the route. Screaming and crying can be heard in the distance as the medium sized beasts have broken through and are running about.
                It's at this time that a large earth shaking bang can be heard as the Large and Huge sized beasts at the gates wall have broken through now a great number of spirits are running through.
                As the players make their way through the underground passage they come across a bridge that they are instructed to walk across.
                They are the last to cross and upon doing so the bridge collapses, a soldier will call out to the party to see if they are okay and to instruct
                them to head to the secondary entrance but to be careful of what lurks down there.
            </p>
            <h4>Arc Mid Point</h4>
            <p>
                As the players venture in they come across strange writings on the walls that describe a future to come. The players will come across a few plant monsters that
                block their way. Once going through the new coridor almost a small stream of magical dust flows alongside. As the players walk through this beautiful passageway
                they come along several gemstones, each for a player to choose that did not choose a special item to start with. Once gotten each forms into a familiar for the
                player looking as they want, they are tiny to small in size. The players then see the exit and make it out a good distance away from the town as the beasts can be seen toppling the last of it.
            </p>

            <h4>Arc Resolution</h4>
            <p>
                After about a few minutes the knight from before comes from around the hill side. He exclaims how happy he is to see they made it out safely and
                suggests going to the nearby town where they can regroup and take shelter. At that point from nearby the town the once bright colored dust darkens and bursts into the air for a few seconds.
                The knight exclaims that yet another layline is corrupted and to hurry and leave this area for you do not want to be there much longer.
            </p>

            <h4><b>ARC 1(Lvl-3) - Learning Spirits and World</b></h4>
            <h4>Arc Purpose</h4>
            <p>
                Players travel through the woods to the next city
                -Long the way get stopped by bandits, some wearing a mask, cloak and others a charm

                Once they get to the next town if the guard is still with them he walks them through
                If not then the guards search their items and will freek out if finding a cultist item

                The party should follow with and when entering the town they are addressed by the city ruler there as well as a witch.
                When the party tells them what happened they will ask about the color of the beasts. If the players give the information then the council before them
                will find it very strange since they know that those kinds of beasts should not appear in that region. The witch that is attending says that they will investigate their
                region to see if anything strange is happening there. One of them mentions that it is happening all over again referring to the one shots. Its at this time that they
                ask the party to help tend to those who were wounded and tells them to find the medical tent were everyone is being held. As the players walk away they might be able
                to hear here exclaim “and just as the epidemic has started”.
            </p>
            <h4>Arc Plot Point 1</h4>

            <h4>ARC 7 - End Game (Min Lvl-18)</h4>
            <p>The players learn who has been behind this all along....</p>
            <p>As this creature is growing more and more powerful and almost getting enough followers to sacrifice to its phylactery to become a Litch/Ulithard Alhoon</p>
            <p>As it so plays out the Alhoon is at its weakest at this time due to the ammount of power it has given to its followers</p>
            <p>Once the players defeat its human form it will use the chaos on the battlefield to suck all of its followers souls into its phylactery claiming that the players will be able to push it over the top</p>
            <p>As it then goes into it's true dragon form. "He starts to laugh at you all as one face becomes three. Three demonic mouths laughing... As the neck grows and the body morphs. The heads seperating into 3 distinct dragon like heads. The body turning a silvery.. scaly.... huge form.... Wings sprout from its back! YOU NOW FACE ME!!!"</p>

                Mornik resides in the Mystic woods where he experiments with plants to create many different potions, drugs, and elixers.
                The players are introduced to him through a drug epidemic thats running wild through one of the villages. People fleeing and
                asking for medicine to help their ill as well as rumors of how much of an adict people from that town are. As the players investigate
                they find out who the cult dealers are and then find out were Mornik is hiding. Though the elixers they pose quite a challenge both getting to them but also defeating them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Posk resides by the illusion shores by the town of the Porcelaina's. There she works to spread fear and nightmares into the hearts of men.
                She uses spirits and other sources to create and bring to life Illusions. As the players work their way to her each battle as a creature is
                killed she will make it look like someone very close to a player to make them feel like they just killed their loved one. The players hear
                about her through people going missing in that region where they encounter the Porcelaina's
            </p>
            <p>
                Ralgu resides in the volcanic region know as the forge. There he focuses on making weapons that are imbued with the power of spirits as well
                as the crystalized form of the mana. Some even using the scales and bones of other monsters. Unlike the others Ralgu was just really good with
                the blade and forced into contract for the bbeg. When the players confront him he tells them he dosnt want to fight but is being forced to. Part
                way through the combat he will try to flee or die easily... but as he does so he freeks out as his arm moves on its own. Forcing Ralgu to swallow
                a strange gem which causes his body to morph into that oh different monsters with four arms each using a different sword/weapon. The players are
                made aware of them through the weapons, tools, and gear that are cursing people or a player. These curses are hard to remove since the way they are
                applied is like a blessing making normal means of magic usless unless the creator undoes it
            </p>
            <p>
                Valdris resides up in the dragon peek mountains. There is has been collecting different beasts, breading them to grow their army, and finding ways
                to cause spirits to spark to gain independence and control them. As well as experimenting on the beasts with different forms of the crystalized mana.
                He provides all of the support to the cult only asking for more experiments and resouces. His ark will start with the introduction to an underground illegal fight club.
                It is there gladiator style the players will be forced into a round with a beast. The more rounds they survive the more that can be earned, but they are also
                tasked with sutting the place down and figuring out whos behind it all. That will then lead the players to the man who sells the beasts to people, who also is
                a slave trader my trade trys to intice the players to a discount. The players can then find out from him or by the chance a dragon flys down and asks the players
                to stop the experiments that are hurting their young. The players will then travel north to the base location. Fighting through the monsters and cultists that are
                their the players find Valdris and eliminate him.
