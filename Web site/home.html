                    <p>	Welcome to Faeruin. A world filled with many different people of all sorts of backgrounds, ideals, and races.</p>
                    <p> 	What stands this plane out is for decades its people have formed a relationship with a spirit to assist them. In its early years disasters would strike the kingdom. People would refer to it as the forest's wrath. These disasters would take many lives which in turn took the lives of their spirits. As these spirits the people rely on can only live if their master does. In present time there are great walls and soldiers with Guardian Spirits that protect the city from these disasters. Though theres one issue… the people have noticed that the quality of their spirits is dwindling. Where once you could see all the detail of the spirit you summoned its gone more to the base forms. </p>

                        I am a blessing and a curse
                        Worn on the sleeves of the kind
                        But golden I shine
                        A measure of the steps climbed
                        I am sought by many
                        and used for gain
                        What am I?

                        Heart of Gold
