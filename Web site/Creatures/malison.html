            Cursed weapons or Malison's as their referred to as are weapons that have been imbued with a soul.

            Its this soul that gives them a cursed property and is different based on each soul.

            A Malison all have one unique ability though to learn and grow far beyond human capabilities..

            If a Malison has a wielder and forms a strong enough bond with them rather than taking control then the Malison is able to share its power with that person. The stronger the bond to an equal goal the more powers and abilities that can be shared.
            Once a strong enough bond is made it can allow the Malison to make an attack through itself 5 times per day in addition to the attack

Slowly making them weaker while also granting more and more benefits such as full armor or a weapon that deals poison damage, or ability to spray a target with poison and fire. It is possible to form a symbiotic relation if the flower is given the fresh blood of an enemy each day.

            Leach healer: slowly drains the wielders health by 1d8dmg and stores half that into a pool of health allowing the wielder to transfer that health to a creature

Grands a +4 to any atk or dmg roll made to deal fire damage. Though every 5th day Efreet tries to take the soul and must beat a DC14 con save and then a DC14 WIS save. If Efreet is freed he envelops the host in a flame prison as his core gaining his fiery elemental body around it. To save the host Efreet must be defeated. If the wielder can save 5 times in a row they subdue Efreet and gain the following ability: Once per day as a bonus action you can manifest a part of Efreets power enveloping your body in flames. You gain resistance to fire damage and your fire based attacks that use cause your opponents to have disadvantage on dex saves

            Cursed item that blinds the wielder but gives them a +2 to hit
            Cursed item that mutes the wielder but gives them a +2 to cha and allows them to know all languages
            Cursed item that defeans wielder but gives a +2 to ac
