                <h3>Daliah</h3>
                <p>
                    Once known as the city of never winter that was once transported away from the material plane to protect itself from a great danger.
                    Known for its enginering in water clocks, gardens, fruits, and other advancments it was sought after and thrived for many year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As time went on and decades passed in a blur it was renamed to Daliah by the locals of the new land.
                    Soon people from all over wanted to see this new place catching the eye of the Dwarfs and those with a will to tinker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daliah nexted within the crystal peak mountains known for its specticals as the sun moves across the sky and hits different holes in the mointain tops. This hits different crystals and shines colored light to tye city bellow. Due to the way the lights hit the city, it has split itself into several districts. Blue, Red, Yellow, Black, Green.
                    Blue Lit District:The district of magic. With a focus on runes and spells.
                    Red Lit District: The district of combat. Those who are knights or proud warries are drawn to this district. Many late night tavern brawles can be found here.
                    Yellow Lit District: The research district. Many artificers are drawn here for technical research. The auto crossbows and spell guns were made here.
                    Black Lit District: At the heart of the city and also known as the rainbow district. This is the buisiest part of the city due to the shopping district, trade shops and more being here.
                    Green Lit District: The floral district. This district is known as the farming district. Being lush and vibrant
                </p>
                <p>

                    At the cities heart is the black light district. This is the buisiest part of the city getting its name from the giant crystal that reflects the incomming sunlight bathing the region in a multitude of shimmering colors.
                    Though all around can find people tinkering with the old and creating the new. Everything from the lamps in the streats, to crossbows that fire multiple times, to mechanical humans taking thier first breaths.

                <h3>City of Clifs</h3>
                <p>
                    The City of Clifs gets its name from being up in the clif sids of several steep mountains known as the Drowning Peaks.
                    This city though rests roughly 100ft off the ground and is comprised of a race known as the Catfae[Cuh-fae] and some harppies.
                    They guard a dungeon said to hold a great mystery but refuse to let just anyone enter their domain.
                    As this city does sit on the sides of clifs its residents have leared to work with it making small bridges between the cliff faces as well as houses that hang from the underside of rock.
                    Though food and water may seem hard to come by here they have learned to harvest gallons of rain watter that they use for their crops, cattle and daily needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A city built onto the side of the cliffs. Home to the Catfae, Harpies, and some Aracrocra. This city is largely made up of connected structures with very little bridges spanning from one to the next. Sometimes, there is 20ft of height difference and / or separation between each.
                    Each structure is balanced with the rocks and brick like support columns while the houses are made from more branches, mud, and some paper.
                    The city is known for its wide array of milks that the catfae have come to love.
                    High within the city within the chiefs office lies a large old door. Inside is a dungeon that protects a great secret.
