        <div name="Places of Inrest">
            <h2>Places of Inrest</h2>
            <h3>Crystal Peeks</h3>
            <p>under the great city of Daliah lies a set of tunnels. 
                The Daliah People have since turned this place into a mine for its valuable resources.
                These crystal mines are a strage occurance found only here where each crystal seeminly corosponds to a Layline in color and ability.
                Do to the caverns nature its easy to get lost here as the twists and turns make it hard to tell where you are going.
            </p>
            <h3>Dragon Scale Mountains</h3>
            <p>
                These mountains are not to be Traversed lightly, feared by
                many for being the home to a vast population of dragons
                Each mountain peak holds a different type of dragon.
            </p>
            <h3>Dwelling of Spirits</h3>
            <p>
                The dwelling of Spirits is as old as the Laylines themselfs.
                Once attempted to be corrupted by the Hand of Ragnarok this
                place holds the Spirit Queen who granted select people with
                the gift to summon a familiar. This place can be reconized
                from a single great tree in the middle of a clearing. Those 
                the Queen of spirits allow are able to enter the tree into
                her dimension. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the queen of Spirits dimension is like a Labyrinth 
                with each twist and turn confusing the senses. Once at the
                center you will be greeted by the Queen of Spirits. Within
                this place she is able to call forth any willing spirit into
                existance.
            </p>
            <h3>Reflecting Waters</h3>
            <p>
            appearing as a lake that reflects a city in the sky that none can see.
            Its guardian is a nympth with two younger sisters who she is very 
            protective of.
            normally when one would enter the water nothing would happen 
            but somone that has been given the prpoer blessing by its
            guardian will be transported to a new dimension. if this 
            is the first time entering the person will have to face
            their worst fears at a test of passage to determine what
            kind of person you are. Apon completion you will enter the 
            lost city of atlantis.
            Alternatively the Reflecting Waters also holds a secret 
            to the lost city of Babylon.

            <h3>Whispering Hallows</h3>
            <h3>Moonlight Coves</h3>
            <p>
                A set of coves that you can walk into from sea level. 
                Appearing as a normal cove by day, but come night when the moon light hits it,
                one would see its true secrets and beauty. Appearing like walls of Opal in the moon 
                lights glow a doorway appears that wasnt there beffor. With a moon at its top and stars 
                down its side. Apon entering the doors

            <h3>Drowning Peaks</h3>
            that spread between the Midnight Woods and the Volcanic Regions.
            To venture into the Volcanic Resions one would need to cross though the steep mountains of the Drowning Peaks avoiding the Rocks from above and the beasts from all around.
            <h3>Realm of Whishes</h3>
