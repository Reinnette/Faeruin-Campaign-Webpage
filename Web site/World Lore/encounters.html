        <h3>Layline Investigation</h3>
        <p>
            Here the players will be tasked with looking into a certain Layline.
            This can range from going into a corrupted Layline and facing the creatures that are there while finding out what happened to the creatures there.
            To going to a Laline that is being threatened.
        </p>

        <h3>Help the Towns Folk</h3>
        <p>
            If the party needs money or some item the Towns Folk are always willing to help out.
            <ul>
                <li>Collecting Herbs for the potion shop.</li>
                <li>Collecting Ores from the mines.</li>
                <li>Defeating a Monstor annoying a person.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Worm of the Crystal Caves</h3>
        <p>
            Bellow Daliah there resides a lush network of crystal caves. Only issue is that weird tunnles have started to appear in these caves with some of the miners going missing.
            The party is tasked with figuring out the cause of this.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the party explores the caves they will find hints at to what caused this such as specific monsters that eat crystals as well as smaller worms in the area.
        </p>

        <h3>Lady of the reflecting waters</h3>
        <p>
            There are reports of a monster that is turning men into pigs over by the reflecting waters.
            The players should investigate about what people have heard and seen as if they get a high role they will learn that one of the townsfolk are seen heading to the lake each evning.
            If the players choose to investigate the npc they will find out her side of the story. She explains that she has lived in this city for quite a while but has a duty to protect the lake.
            People of the town keep coming looking for the lost city of Atlantis and or to capture her younger sisters to sell them off into slavery.
            Once the players go to the lake they will see armed warriors fighting a siren with to young ones behind her.
            The party can choose what to do weather to help fight against her or weather to help her. If they help her after defeating or calling off the towns folk they will get her blessing
            allowing the party to indeed enter the thought to be lost city of Atlantis.
        </p>
        <h3>The non-Fae Fae</h3>
        <p>
            There exists a human who doesn't know they are a fae....
            As time goes on they almost begin to fade from existence. Its up to the players to figure out that this fae has not drawn in energy in quite a long time and needs to be recharged.
            Leading them to the nearby well spring they find that the cult is about to destroy it. In a now race against time the players must stop the cultist and get this fae into the well spring before they fully disappear.
        </p>
        <h3>Missing Persons</h3>
        <p>
            When the players awake they have the option to explore the town
            Opting to go their separate ways or together
            depending on what the players do depends on the nature of the quest
            - Wander the city: A player will see a helpless woman beaten on the street.
            If they choose to help they will find that a tavern worker comes out to ask what they are doing with their property
            - Guild hall: There is a quest they find about woman and children going missing

            Either line will lead the players to the basement of the tavern were a secret trap door lies.
            Going down the players will find tunnels and rooms that appear to be used simi often.
            At the same time if a player got captured they can try to escape with the other woman and children or alone
            The players will likely uncover another location that the cultist are hiding within the city
            and if noticed the players will see these people have the same emblems as the bandits they fought
            Here the players will find the woman and children and while attempting to free them will be spotted by the guards.
            A fight will then take place in the simi dark area were the players will have to defend themselves and to woman/children
            Upon making it out and freeing them they will complete this quest line and be asked to meet Infront of the leaders of the town
            The leaders will thank the players for saving them

            The players solving the riddle will be lead to the old and sealed off crypt
            The door to such has a lock system that has been forgotten by all
            Once inside the players will be on a slight dungeon crawl with traps and monsters
            After clearing out the several rooms they will encounter the final chamber where a leader of the cult is planning their next move on the town with several trusted members
            Once beaten the boss the players will be able to loot the area. If they find the hidden lever they may even find the treasure room
            The players may also find the following: List of cult lead names, locations of operation, info about their plans, or next location to attack
            The players will then leave through the hidden passage way

            The players find themself on the outskirt of town with potentially new knowledge
            The players must then decide what to do
        </p>

        <h3>Raining Cats and Spirits</h3>
        <p>
            The party gets word that in a neighboring city it has had spirit animals falling out of the sky seemly randomly.
            They would like the party to investigate this as it is starting to cause damage to the buildings and harm to the people.
            The party is directed to go to the local guild hall for more information.
            The guild will tell them that many people have submitted missing spirit animals requests but none have ever been found and they always disapear at night.
            As the players investigate one of the spirit animals is about to fall on them (DC12 Dex save).
            After watching the sky the party can see that birds are randomly turning into animals and falling.
            The party can either talk to one of the animals, try to devise a trap to see where the animals are going, of if one of the players roll an perception 18 can see a shadow on the roof tops.
            Once found out the party can head in the direction where the reports are comming from where they will find a cultist that is taking spirit animals and experimenting on them.
            His goals are to see what the limits are to such where once enganged he will toss out a few spirit animals as pawns to fight the party.
            The cultist himself isnt to strong but where he is strong is in numbers due to commanding/controlling so many different spirits.
        </p>

        <h3>The Whishing Wells</h3>
        <p>
            Ever wonder where whish's from a whishing well come from. Well one of the local wells has stopped producing whishes and the party is asked to figure out why.
            Apon inspection of the whishing well and throwing a coin in it can be seen that the coin magically disapears just as it normally would do, but rather than granting a small and simple whish
            nothing happens. After some investigation or if the party needs help have a stranger bumb into they and see if either they or some other object falls into the well.
            At which point the players should notice that not only coins can go into the well.
            Once all players enter they are meet with a new world and a person that is very unhappy to see them as they are not allowed to be there.
            But none the less they welcome the party to the whishing world where many giene's reside and recieve that is then turned into a small and simple whish. Almost all of the giene's love this though
            some do try to escape tho its said they live lives within containers making wishes for random people without payment.
            There is an issue though as pixies have found their way in and are stealing the coins before the geines and get them.
            The party is told that the pixies always take the coins back through to a specific well
        </p>
